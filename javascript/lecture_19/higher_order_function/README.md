# Higher order function :-

def 1 :-
when you two functions fn A and fn B, assume that fn B is sent as an argument to the other fn A then we say that the accepting fn is your higher order function (fn A).

def 2 :-
when I have an outer fn and inside that fn I have another fn (inner) an I am returning the inner the inner fn then the outer function is known as higher order function.

# Call Back Function :-

fn which is sent as an argument is known as call back function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Closures:-

Whenever we return a fn it is never returned alone it is always returned with its dependent lexical environment.

                                     or
                    
function bundle together with lexical scope. 


## USAGE:
